# Webspan
A simple utility for scanning the known web

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Look at the tops of the files, and change variables as you see fit. The default configuration will work just fine, however.
3. Run `python scan_external.py`
4. Send a keyboard interrupt (ctrl+c) to end the program and save the data to a file

##  Motivation
I wanted to create some form of web scraper, and I was inspired by the classic Wikipedia-traveling game where you try to jump from one article to another. Perhaps I will build upon this framework or turn it into something interesting in the future.
